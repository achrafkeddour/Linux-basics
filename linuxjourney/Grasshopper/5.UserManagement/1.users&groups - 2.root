#In an OS , users and groups are used to control access to files, programs, and system settings. 

#The system uses user ids (UID) to manage users, usernames are the friendly way to associate users with identification, but the system identifies users by their UID
#groups are identified by the system with their group ID (GID)

#Sometimes users are system daemons that continuously run processes to keep the system functioning.
#root is the most important & powerful user on the system, root can access any file and start and terminate any process.
#we enable it by : sudo su , or sudo ourcommand
