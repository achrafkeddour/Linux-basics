#Adding Users :

#You can use the 'adduser' or the 'useradd' command.
# 'adduser' command contains more helpful features such as making a home directory and more. 
#There are configuration files for adding new users that can be customized depending on what you want to allocate to a default user.

$ sudo useradd bob
$ sudo adduser bob


#Removing Users
$ sudo userdel bob



#Changing Passwords
$ passwd bob
#This will allow you to change the password of yourself or another user (if you are root).
