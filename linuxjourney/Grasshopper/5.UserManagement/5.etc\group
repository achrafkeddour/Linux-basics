#This file allows for different groups with different permissions. 


#Very similar to the /etc/password field, the /etc/group fields are as follows:

#    Group name
#    Group password - there isnt a need to set a group password, using an elevated privilege like sudo is standard. A "*" will be put in place as the default value.
#    Group ID (GID)
#    List of users - you can manually specify users you want in a specific group
