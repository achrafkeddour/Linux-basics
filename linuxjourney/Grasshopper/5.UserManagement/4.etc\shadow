#The /etc/shadow file is used to store information about user authentication. It requires superuser read permissions. 

$ sudo cat /etc/shadow
root:MyEPTEa$6Nonsense:15000:0:99999:7:::
#username:password_hash:last_change:min_age:max_age:warning:inactive:expire


#in the password field you'll see an encrypted password. The fields are separated by colons

#1. Username
#2. Encrypted password
#3. Date of last password changed - expressed as the number of days since Jan 1, 1970. If there is a 0 that means the user should change their password the next time they login
#4. Minimum password age - Days that a user will have to wait before being able to change their password again
#5. Maximum password age - Maximum number of days before a user has to change their password
#6. Password warning period - Number of days before a password is going to expire
#7. Password inactivity period - Number of days after a password has expired to allow login with their password
#8. Account expiration date - date that user will not be able to login
#9. Reserved field for future use


#In most distributions today, user authentication doesn't rely on just the /etc/shadow file, 
#there are other mechanisms in place such as PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) that replace authentication.
