# Vim: The Improved Text Editor

Vim (Vi IMproved) is a powerful and versatile text editor that extends the capabilities of the original `vi` editor. Here’s a detailed guide to some essential Vim features and commands.

## 1. Starting Vim
To start editing a file with Vim:
```bash
$ vim file.txt
```

Open files in split windows from the command line: 
```bash
$ vim -o file1.txt file2.txt
```
-  o: Opens files in horizontal splits.
-  Use -O for vertical splits

## 2. Search Patterns
- **Forward Search:** Press `/`, followed by the search term, and press `Enter`.
  ```vim
  /pattern
  ```
  - Press `n` to go to the next occurrence.
  - Press `N` to go to the previous occurrence.
- **Backward Search:** Press `?`, followed by the search term.
  ```vim
  ?pattern
  ```

- **Quick Tip**: If you’re at the top of a file, / is more useful; if you’re at the bottom, ? might be faster to find something above.
