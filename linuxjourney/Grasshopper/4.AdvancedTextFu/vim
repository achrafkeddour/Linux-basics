#Vim stands for vi (Improved) just like its name it stands for an improved version of the vi text editor command
#we start using it with 'vim file.txt'

#4. Vim Search Patterns :
#just type the / key and then your search result while you are in a vim session
#press "n" to go forward or "N" to go backward in your search results

vim file.txt : My pretty file is very pretty.

/pretty

# will find the pretty words in the text file. press n to check all of them
#(we can use ?pretty for search also but result will start from the last)


#5. Vim Navigation
#the mouse is nowhere in use here. To navigate a text document in vim, use the following keys: 
#h or the left arrow - will move you left one character
#k or the up arrow - will move you up one line
#j or the down arrow - will move you down one line
#l or the right arrow - will move you right one character


#6. Vim Appending Text
#  i - insert text before the cursor
#  O - insert text on the previous line
#  o - insert text on the next line
#  a - append text after the cursor
#  A - append text at the end of the line

#To exit insert mode and go back to command mode, just hit the Esc key.
