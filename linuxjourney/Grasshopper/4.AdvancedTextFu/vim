#Vim stands for vi (Improved) just like its name it stands for an improved version of the vi text editor command
#we start using it with 'vim file.txt'

#4. Vim Search Patterns :
#just type the / key and then your search result while you are in a vim session
#
press "n" to go forward or "N" to go backward in your search results

vim file.txt : My pretty file is very pretty.

/pretty

# will find the pretty words in the text file. press n to check all of them
#(we can use ?pretty for search also but result will start from the last)
