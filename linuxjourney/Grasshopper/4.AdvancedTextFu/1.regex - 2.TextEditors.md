### 1 Regex, or regular expression :  
 is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. It's used in Linux for tasks like searching, matching, and manipulating text in files or streams.

#our text forhttps://github.com/achrafkeddour/Linux-basics/new/main/linuxjourney/Grasshopper/4.AdvancedTextFu testing :

sally sells seashells 
by the seashore

 (what we will apply now is in searching case .. like vim we search using '/' )
#which means i open a file using 'vim file.txt' , then i click / for searching , then i start apply what is next 

1. Beginning of a line with ^
^by
would match the line "by the seashore"

2. End of a line with $
seashore$
would match the line "by the seashore"

3. Matching any single character with .
b.
would match by

4. Bracket notation with []
#This can be a little tricky, brackets allow us to specify characters found within the bracket.
d[iou]g
would match: dig, dog, dug

#The previous anchor tag ^ when used in a bracket means anything except the characters within the bracket.
d[^i]g
would match: dog and dug but not dig

#Brackets can also use ranges to increase the amount of characters you want to use.
d[a-c]g
will match patterns like dag, dbg, and dcg

#Be careful though as brackets are case sensitive:
d[A-C]g
will match dAg, dBg and dCg but not dag, dbg and dcg



### 2. vim and emacs : They are essentially coding, word document processing and basically all in one editors. (on applique cha kouna nhdrou fihoum)
