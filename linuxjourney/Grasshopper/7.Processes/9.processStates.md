# 9. Process States

Let's take a look at the `ps aux` command again:

```bash
$ ps aux
```

In the `STAT` column, you'll see different letters that show the state of each process. Hereâ€™s a simple explanation of the most common ones:

- **R:** Running or ready to run. The process is using the CPU or waiting for it.
- **S:** Sleeping. The process is waiting for something to happen, like input from a user.
- **D:** Deep sleep. The process is stuck waiting for something it can't control, like a disk read. You can't stop it easily.
- **Z:** Zombie. The process has finished but is still waiting to be fully cleaned up by the system.
- **T:** Stopped. The process has been paused or stopped, usually by a signal or a user.
