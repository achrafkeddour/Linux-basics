# 5. Process Termination

A process can exit using the `_exit` system call, which frees up the resources that the process was using for reallocation. When a process is ready to terminate, it provides the kernel with a **termination status**. 

- A status of **0** typically indicates that the process succeeded.
- However, termination is not complete until the **parent process** acknowledges the child's termination by using the **`wait` system call**. 
  - This call checks the termination status of the child process.
  - The `wait` call is essential, as it ensures the parent process knows the outcome of its child.

Another way to terminate a process involves using **signals**, which will be discussed later.

## Orphan Processes

If a **parent process** dies before its child, the kernel understands that it won’t receive a `wait` call. To handle this:

- The kernel marks these child processes as **orphans**.
- Orphan processes are adopted by **`init`** (the "mother" of all processes).
- Eventually, `init` will call the `wait` system call for these orphans, allowing them to terminate properly.

---

## Zombie Processes

When a child process terminates but the **parent process** hasn’t called `wait` yet, the kernel retains some information about the child’s termination. This creates a **zombie process**.

- The resources used by the child process are freed, but there’s still an entry in the **process table** for the zombie.
- **Zombie processes cannot be killed** since they are already considered "dead." 
  - You can’t use signals to kill them.
- When the parent calls the `wait` system call, the zombie process will disappear. This is known as **reaping**.
  
If the parent process never performs the `wait` call, `init` will adopt the zombie and eventually perform `wait` to remove it.

### Why Zombie Processes Are a Problem

- **Zombie processes** can take up space in the process table.
- If the process table becomes full, it prevents new processes from running.
