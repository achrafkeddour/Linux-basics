When a computer starts a new task (process), it copies an existing task using something called the "fork" system call. This creates a new process, called the child, which is almost identical to the original process (the parent). The child gets its own unique process ID (PID), and the original process becomes its parent, identified by a parent process ID (PPID).


After the child process is created, it can either continue doing the same thing as the parent or use another system call called "execve" to start a new program. When this happens, the system clears out the old program and sets up everything for the new one.


You can see this in action with the command `ps l`, which shows a list of processes. One of the processes you’ll see is your shell (like bash). When you run a command like `ps l` from the shell, you'll notice that the shell's PID becomes the PPID of the `ps` command, because the shell "gave birth" to the `ps` process.


Now, every process must have a parent. So where does it all begin? The very first process, called `init`, is created by the system when it boots up. `init` has a special PID of 1, and it spawns all other processes on the system. It runs with root privileges and stays active until the system is shut down.

```
When you run a command in a terminal, the shell (parent process) creates a new process (child process) using fork().

### Example 1: Using `fork()` to create a child process

In this example, we’ll create a new process using `fork()`. The parent process will print a message, and the child process will print a different message.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>  // Needed for fork()

int main() {
    pid_t pid = fork();  // Create a new process

    if (pid == 0) {
        // This block runs in the child process
        printf("Hello from the child process!\n");
    } else {
        // This block runs in the parent process
        printf("Hello from the parent process!\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The `fork()` system call creates a new process. It returns 0 to the child process and the child's PID to the parent.
- The parent process and child process both continue running their own code after the `fork()`. In this case, they print different messages.

### Example 2: Using `execve()` to run a new program

Now let’s modify the child process so that after it's created, it replaces itself with a new program using the `execve()` system call.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>  // Needed for fork() and execve()
#include <stdlib.h>  // Needed for exit()

int main() {
    pid_t pid = fork();  // Create a new process

    if (pid == 0) {
        // This block runs in the child process
        char *args[] = {"/bin/ls", NULL};  // The program to run (ls) and its arguments
        execve("/bin/ls", args, NULL);     // Replace the child process with ls
        printf("This won't be printed if execve() works!\n");
    } else {
        // This block runs in the parent process
        printf("Hello from the parent process!\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The parent process prints a message and keeps running.
- The child process uses `execve()` to replace itself with the `ls` command, which lists files in the current directory.
- If `execve()` works, the child will not continue its original code (it becomes the `ls` program).
  
### Example 3: Checking PIDs of Parent and Child

Here’s another simple example that shows the PID and PPID for both the parent and child processes.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid = fork();  // Create a new process

    if (pid == 0) {
        // Child process
        printf("Child process: My PID is %d, and my parent's PID is %d\n", getpid(), getppid());
    } else {
        // Parent process
        printf("Parent process: My PID is %d, and my child's PID is %d\n", getpid(), pid);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The `getpid()` function returns the process's own PID.
- The `getppid()` function returns the PID of the parent process.
- This example helps you see the relationship between parent and child processes through their PIDs.

These examples explain how processes are created and can run different programs!
