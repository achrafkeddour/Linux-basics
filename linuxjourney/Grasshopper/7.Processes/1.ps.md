## What is a Process?

A **process** is a running instance of a program. When you open a program, such as a browser, text editor, or even a simple terminal command, the operating system runs it as a process. Every process in Linux is assigned a unique **Process ID (PID)** by the operating system.

**Types of Processes:**

- **Foreground**: The ones you actively interact with, like a terminal session or a GUI application.
- **Background**: System services or daemons that run behind the scenes.

## The `ps` Command

The `ps` command in Linux allows you to view the running processes. It shows details about the processes currently active on your machine. By default, when you run `ps` without any options, it shows processes associated with the **current** terminal session.

**Basic `ps` Output:**

```bash
$ ps 
PID    TTY    STAT    TIME    CMD
41230  pts/4  Ss      00:00:00 bash
51224  pts/4  R+      00:00:00 ps
```

Let’s explain each column:

- **PID**: The Process ID – a unique number assigned to each process.
- **TTY**: The controlling terminal for the process (e.g., pts/4). It's the terminal that started the process. Background system processes often don't have a TTY (verify with `ps -e -o pid,comm,tty`).
- **STAT**: The current status of the process. Some common values are:
  - `S`: Sleeping (waiting for an event to complete).
  - `R`: Running (currently being executed by the CPU).
  - `T`: Stopped (e.g., by a job control signal).
  - `Z`: Zombie (the process has finished but its parent hasn’t read its exit status).
  - `D`: Uninterruptible sleep, usually IO (input/output) processes waiting for hardware resources.
- **TIME**: The total amount of CPU time the process has consumed since it started.
- **CMD**: The command that started the process (e.g., bash, ps).

## Understanding the `ps aux` Command

To get more detailed information about processes across the system (not just for the current terminal), use: 

```bash
ps aux
```

This command uses BSD-style options, and here’s what the options do:

- `a`: Shows processes from all users, not just your own.
- `u`: Displays more detailed information, including the user who owns the process.
- `x`: Includes processes that are not attached to a terminal (such as system services).

**Example Output:**

```bash
USER       PID  %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
root         1  0.0  0.1 171548  7928 ?        Ss   08:00   0:04 /sbin/init
user1      256  0.1  1.2 980432 50300 pts/1    R+   08:05   0:03 /usr/bin/python3
root       102  0.0  0.0  16276  1456 ?        Ss   08:01   0:00 /usr/sbin/cron
```

**Additional Columns Explained:**

- **USER**: The user who started the process.
- **%CPU**: The percentage of CPU resources the process is using.
- **%MEM**: The percentage of memory the process is using.
- **VSZ**: Virtual memory size (in kilobytes) used by the process.
- **RSS**: Resident Set Size (the amount of non-swapped physical memory used by the process).
- **START**: The time the process started.
- **COMMAND**: The command or path to the executable that initiated the process.

### Example: Running and Understanding `ps aux`

To see the first 10 processes running on the system:

```bash
ps aux | head -n 10
```

To explore which processes are consuming the most memory or CPU:

```bash
ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head
```
This sorts the processes by CPU usage, with the highest usage at the top.

To filter processes related to "mysql":

```bash
ps aux | grep mysql
```

## Real-time Process Monitoring with `top`

While `ps` shows a snapshot of processes at the time the command is run, for **real-time process monitoring**, use the `top` command:

```bash
top
```

In `top`, you will see a live, continuously updating list of running processes. Useful keys in `top`:

- **`q`**: Quit.
- **`h`**: Help.
- **`P`**: Sort by CPU usage.
- **`M`**: Sort by memory usage.
