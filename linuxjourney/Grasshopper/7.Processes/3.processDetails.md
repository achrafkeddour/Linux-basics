How processes work in an operating system, how the kernel manages these processes and their resources.

### Process Overview:
A **process** is an instance of a running program. When you run a program (like `cat`), the system allocates necessary resources, such as memory, CPU, and I/O, to make it run. These resources are finite, and each process competes for its share.

In the example given:
1. Open 3 terminal windows.
2. In two windows, run `cat` (without any file or options). Since `cat` waits for input from stdin (keyboard), it remains running, waiting for user input.
3. In the third window, run `ps aux | grep cat`. This command lists all processes and filters those related to `cat`.

Even though both commands are running the same `cat` program, the system creates **two separate processes**. Each instance of a program gets its own process ID (PID) and resources, so they are treated independently.

### Role of the Kernel:
The **kernel** (core part of the OS) is responsible for managing these processes. When you run a program, the kernel:
1. **Loads the program** into memory.
2. **Allocates resources** (like CPU time, memory space, and I/O devices) for the process.
3. **Tracks the process**, ensuring it behaves as expected and gets the resources it needs.

The kernel keeps track of:
- **Process status**: whether the process is running, waiting, or terminated.
- **Resources in use**: how much memory, CPU, and I/O each process is using.
- **Ownership**: which user started the process and who "owns" it.
- **Signal handling**: how the process responds to system signals (such as termination or pause signals).

### Resource Allocation:
The kernel ensures that all processes get their fair share of resources based on their demands. For example, a CPU-intensive process may get more CPU time than an idle one. When a process finishes, the resources it was using are freed, allowing other processes to use them.

In short, processes are individual instances of programs that require resources to run, and the kernel handles the allocation and tracking of these resources.
