Of course! Let's break down this lesson on **Controlling Terminals** step-by-step so it's easier to understand.

### What is a Terminal (TTY)?

In Linux, the **TTY** field in the `ps` output stands for **teletypewriter**. Historically, it referred to physical devices that were used to interact with the computer, but now it represents the **terminal** that you use to interact with the system.

The **TTY** field (an output for ps command) helps us see which terminal started the process. (**controlling terminal**).

### Two Types of Terminals: Regular and Pseudoterminal

There are **two types** of terminals in Linux:

1. **Regular Terminal Devices**:
   - These are the basic terminals (text-mode) that interact directly with the system hardware.
   - You can access these virtual consoles by pressing `Ctrl + Alt + F1` to `F6` on most Linux systems. 
   - When you switch to one of these, you see a bare command-line interface without any graphical interface (no desktop environment).
   - You can return to the graphical desktop by pressing `Ctrl + Alt + F7` (sometimes `F2` depending on the system).
   
   **Example of a Regular Terminal Device:**
   If you switch to `TTY1` with `Ctrl + Alt + F1`, you are in a regular terminal. This terminal has no graphical user interface, and you're directly typing commands into a low-level console.

2. **Pseudoterminal Devices (PTS)**:
   - These are the terminals you typically use in a **graphical environment**. They are emulated terminals, meaning they act like a real terminal but run within a window (such as the terminal you use in your desktop environment).
   - The output of `ps` shows **PTS** (Pseudoterminal Slave) for processes running in these terminal windows.
   
   **Example of a Pseudoterminal Device:**
   When you open your terminal application (like GNOME Terminal or Konsole), it’s actually a **pseudoterminal**, often listed as `pts/*` in `ps`.

### How to View the Terminal in `ps`

If you run `ps` in your terminal, you'll see something like:

```bash
ps
```
```bash
PID    TTY      STAT   TIME    CMD
41230  pts/4    Ss     00:00:00 bash
51224  pts/4    R+     00:00:00 ps
```

Here:
- `pts/4` means your process is running on a **pseudoterminal**, which is what you typically use in a graphical environment.
- If you switched to a **regular terminal** (e.g., using `Ctrl + Alt + F1`), the TTY would show something like `tty1`.

### The Controlling Terminal

The **controlling terminal** is the terminal where the process was started. Processes are usually **bound to a controlling terminal**, meaning if you close the terminal, the process will be terminated.

For example:
- If you run a command like `find` in your terminal window and then **close the terminal**, the process will be killed because the terminal was its controlling terminal.

### Daemon Processes and the `TTY` Field

There are certain processes, called **daemon processes**, that don’t need a terminal at all. These are system services (like web servers, logging services, etc.) that run **in the background** and keep the system running smoothly.

Since daemon processes are not started by a terminal, they **don’t have a controlling terminal**. In the `ps` output, the TTY field for these processes is listed as `?`. This means the process is not associated with any terminal and will keep running even if you close all terminals.

**Example of a Daemon Process:**
```bash
ps aux | grep systemd
```
```bash
root        1  0.0  0.1 171548  7928 ?        Ss   08:00   0:04 /sbin/init
```
- Here, the `TTY` field is `?`, meaning the `systemd` process (a core system process) doesn’t have a controlling terminal.

Daemon processes are usually started during system boot and shut down only when the system is shut down.

### Summary of Key Concepts

1. **TTY (Teletypewriter)**: Represents the terminal that started the process.
2. **Regular Terminal**: Accessed via `Ctrl + Alt + F1` to `F6` – a raw, text-only terminal.
3. **Pseudoterminal (PTS)**: The terminal emulator window you use within a graphical interface, like the GNOME Terminal or XTerm.
4. **Controlling Terminal**: The terminal associated with a process. If the terminal is closed, the process will also terminate.
5. **Daemon Processes**: Background processes that don’t have a controlling terminal (denoted by `?` in the TTY field in `ps`).

### Actions You Can Take

1. **Switch to Regular Terminals**: Try `Ctrl + Alt + F1` to see a raw terminal, and use `Ctrl + Alt + F7` to return to the graphical interface.
2. **Check Pseudoterminals**: Run `ps` in your terminal window and note the `pts/*` value for your processes.
3. **See Daemon Processes**: Use `ps aux` and observe that daemon processes have `?` in the TTY column because they don’t have a controlling terminal.
