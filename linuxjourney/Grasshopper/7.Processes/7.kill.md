# Process Termination and Signals in Linux

 By default, `kill <PID>` sends a `SIGTERM` signal to the specified process.

### Default Behavior: `SIGTERM`
- The **SIGTERM** signal is sent to a process to request its termination. allowing it to:
  - Cleanly release its resources.
  - Save its state before exiting.
  
Example:
```bash
kill <PID>
```

## Specifying a Signal with `kill`

You can also specify a different signal when terminating a process by using the signal number:

```bash
kill -9 12445
```

- In this case, `-9` specifies the **SIGKILL** signal, which forcefully kills the process without allowing it to clean up.

## Common Signals and Their Differences

Linux provides various signals to control and manage processes. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of some common ones:

### 1. **SIGHUP** (Hangup)
- **Trigger:** Sent when the controlling terminal is closed (e.g., when you close a terminal window).
- **Usage:** Often used to reload configuration files in daemons, as opposed to killing them.
  
### 2. **SIGINT** (Interrupt)
- **Trigger:** Sent when you press `Ctrl-C` in the terminal.
- **Effect:** Requests the process to terminate gracefully.
- **Usage:** Ideal for stopping a process without forcing it to exit immediately.

### 3. **SIGTERM** (Terminate)
- **Trigger:** Default signal sent by `kill` (without a specified signal).
- **Effect:** Asks the process to terminate, but allows it to perform cleanup operations.
- **Usage:** Use this signal when you want to safely stop a process.

### 4. **SIGKILL** (Kill)
- **Trigger:** Sent when you use `kill -9 <PID>`.
- **Effect:** Forcefully kills the process immediately, without giving it a chance to clean up.
- **Usage:** Only use **SIGKILL** when a process is unresponsive or refusing to terminate using **SIGTERM**.

### 5. **SIGSTOP** (Stop)
- **Trigger:** Suspends a process without terminating it.
- **Effect:** Pauses the process, allowing it to be resumed later with a `SIGCONT`.
- **Usage:** Useful for debugging or temporarily halting a process without killing it.
```
kill -STOP 1234 #we stop a process
kill -CONT 1234 #we continue the process (we use fg %1 to resume in the foreground or bg %1 for background)
```

### Summary of Key Signals

| Signal    | Number | Description                                             |
|-----------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `SIGHUP`  | 1      | Hangup; sent when the terminal is closed                |
| `SIGINT`  | 2      | Interrupt; sent via `Ctrl-C`, requests graceful exit    |
| `SIGTERM` | 15     | Terminate; asks process to terminate and clean up       |
| `SIGKILL` | 9      | Kill; forcefully kills process without cleanup          |
| `SIGSTOP` | (no number) | Stop; suspends the process (can be resumed)          |
