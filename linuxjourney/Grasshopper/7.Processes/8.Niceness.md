# 8. Niceness

When you run multiple applications on your computer, like Chrome, Microsoft Word, or Photoshop, it may seem like they are running simultaneously, but this isn't entirely true.

## Time Slices and Process Scheduling

Processes use the CPU for a short period, called a **time slice**. After a process uses its time slice, it pauses for milliseconds, and another process gets its turn. This system is managed by the kernel using a **round-robin scheduling** method, ensuring each process gets enough CPU time until it completes.

### Niceness and CPU Priority

While processes donâ€™t control when or how long they get CPU time, there is a way to influence the kernel's scheduling algorithm using **niceness**.

- **Niceness** determines a process's priority for CPU time. 
  - **High niceness (positive number)**: The process is "nice" and gets lower CPU priority.
  - **Low or negative niceness**: The process is "less nice" and demands more CPU time.

You can view the niceness levels of running processes using the `top` command, where the **NI** column represents the niceness level.

### Commands to Manage Niceness

1. **`nice` command**: Used to set the priority for a new process.

    ```bash
    $ nice -n 5 apt upgrade
    ```

    In this example, the `apt upgrade` command will run with a niceness value of 5, giving it a lower CPU priority.

2. **`renice` command**: Used to change the priority of an existing process.

    ```bash
    $ renice 10 -p 3245
    ```

    This command changes the niceness of the process with PID 3245 to 10, lowering its CPU priority.

### Summary

- **Niceness** is a way to manage CPU priority.
- Higher niceness = lower CPU priority (process is "nice").
- Lower niceness = higher CPU priority (process is "greedy").
- Use `nice` for new processes and `renice` for existing ones.
