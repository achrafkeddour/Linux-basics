 cp mycoolfile /home/pete/Documents/cooldocs

* the wildcard of wildcards, it's used to represent all single characters or any string.
$ cp *.jpg /home/pete/Pictures

 useful command is to use the -r flag, this will recursively copy the files and directories within a directory. (directory complete)
$ cp -r directoryname/ /home/achraf/Documents
rm -r directoryhaha //to delete all the directory (use rm not rmdir)

if you copy a file over to a directory that has the same filename, the file will be overwritten with whatever you are copying over. 
You can use the -i flag (interactive) to prompt you before overwriting a file.
$ cp -i mycoolfile /home/pete/Pictures //i may have a 'mycoolfile' in 'Pictures' directory


You can rename files or directories like this: $ mv oldfile newfile .. $ mv directory1 directory2
And move one file or more : $ mv file_1 file_2 /somedirectory
if you mv a file or directory it will overwrite anything in the same directory. 
So you can use the -i flag to prompt you before overwriting anything.
mv -i directory1 directory2

Letâ€™s say you did want to mv a file to overwrite the previous one. 
You can also make a backup of that file and it will just rename the old version with a ~.
$ mv -b directory1 directory2


mkdir dir1 dir2 //creating a lot of directories 
$ mkdir -p Documents/directoryjdida/subdirjdida //creating subdirectory and its container (both)
