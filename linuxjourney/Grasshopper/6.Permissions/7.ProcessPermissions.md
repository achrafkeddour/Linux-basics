There are three UIDS associated with every process:

## 1 effective user ID :

**The effective UID is what is checked for permission to access or modify files.**

The effective user ID determines the actual permissions that a process has while accessing system resources.

If a process is running under a setuid program, the EUID will be temporarily changed to the UID of the file owner, rather than the user who executed it.

(Setuid (set user ID) allows users to run an executable with the permissions of the file owner (instead of their own).)


## 2 Real user ID

The real user ID identifies the user **who created or owns the process**. It corresponds to the actual user who started the process.
