There are three UIDS associated with every process:

## 1 Real user ID

The real user ID identifies the user **who created or owns the process (let's say 'owns' more than 'created')**. It corresponds to the actual user who started the process.
The real UID is constant unless manipulated by certain system calls like setuid().

## 2 effective user ID :

**The effective UID is what is checked for permission to access or modify files.**

The effective user ID determines the actual permissions that a process has while accessing system resources.

If a process is running under a setuid program, the EUID will be temporarily changed to the UID of the file owner, rather than the user who executed it.

(Setuid (set user ID) allows users to run an executable with the permissions of the file owner (instead of their own).)

we can set the EUID to the RUID

```
int main() {
    // Get and print the real, effective, and saved user IDs
    int real_uid = getuid();
    int effective_uid = geteuid();
    printf("Initial Real UID: %d\n", real_uid); // ruid is 1000
    printf("Initial Effective UID: %d\n", effective_uid); // euid is 0

    // Drop privileges by setting the effective UID to the real UID 
    seteuid(real_uid); 
    printf("After dropping privileges (Effective UID): %d\n", geteuid()); //euid becomes 1000 also

    return 0;
}
``` 

## 3 Saved Set User ID (SUID)

```
Saved UID is used to store the previous Effective UID when a process temporarily changes its privileges.
It allows a process to drop elevated privileges and later regain them securely.
The Saved UID is automatically managed by the system and plays a key role in privilege switching for setuid programs.
```

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    // Get and print the real, effective, and saved user IDs
    int real_uid = getuid();
    int effective_uid = geteuid();
    printf("Initial Real UID: %d\n", real_uid);
    printf("Initial Effective UID: %d\n", effective_uid);

    // Drop privileges by setting the effective UID to the real UID
    seteuid(real_uid);
    printf("After dropping privileges (Effective UID): %d\n", geteuid());

    // Assume the program has setuid privilege and switch back to saved UID
    seteuid(effective_uid);  // Switch back to original effective UID
    printf("After regaining privileges (Effective UID): %d\n", geteuid());

    return 0;
}
```
