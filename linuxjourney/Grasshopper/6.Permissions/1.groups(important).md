**1. Create the group developers:** 

```
sudo groupadd developers
```

**2. Add users to the group:**
```
sudo usermod -aG developers achraf
sudo usermod -aG developers lakhour
```

**3. remove users from the group:**
```
sudo deluser achraf developers
```
**or i can made changes in /etc/group**

**4. Change the group ownership of a file to `developers` :**
```
sudo chgrp developers file.txt
```

#### **change owner and group ownership in same time**
```
chown newuser:newgroup filename
```

**5. Set the file permissions :**
```
chmod 760 project.txt
```
### i prefered to put others as : 0 to create another user that is not include in developers i try (it will fail)
