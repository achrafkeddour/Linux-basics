**1. Create the group developers:** 

```
sudo groupadd developers
```

**2. Add users to the group:**
```
sudo usermod -aG developers achraf
sudo usermod -aG developers lakhour
``` 
**3. Change the group ownership of a file to `developers` :**
```
sudo chgrp developers file.txt
```
**4. Set the file permissions :**
```
chmod 760 project.txt
```
