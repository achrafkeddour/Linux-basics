**Changing permissions can easily be done with the chmod command**

pick which permission set you want to change, user, group or other.
You can add or remove permissions with a + or -
#### example 
```
$ chmod u+x myfile
```
means : change permission on myfile by adding executable permission bit on the user set. So now the user has executable permission on this file!
