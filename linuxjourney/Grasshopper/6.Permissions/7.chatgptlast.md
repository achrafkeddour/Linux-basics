# **Understanding Real UID, Effective UID, Saved UID, and Setuid in Linux**

## **1. Introduction to User IDs in Linux**

In Linux, processes are associated with three key types of User IDs:
1. **Real User ID (Real UID)**: The actual user who started the process.
2. **Effective User ID (Effective UID)**: The user ID that the system checks when determining permissions for accessing files, executing processes, and more.
3. **Saved Set-User-ID (Saved UID or ssuid)**: A backup of the Effective UID that allows a process to regain privileges later.

These IDs are critical for managing permissions and privileges, especially for programs that need to perform actions as a different user (e.g., root).

## **2. What are Real UID, Effective UID, and Saved UID?**

### **2.1 Real User ID (Real UID)**

- **Definition**: This is the user ID of the person who started the process. It identifies the actual owner of the process.
- **Use Case**: The Real UID doesn't usually change during the life of a process. It's used for accounting purposes and to check who owns the process.

**Example**:
If you are logged in as a user with UID `1000`, any program you run will have a Real UID of `1000`.

### **2.2 Effective User ID (Effective UID)**

- **Definition**: The Effective UID determines the permissions that the process runs with. It is used for access control checks, such as reading files, writing to files, or executing other programs.
- **Use Case**: The Effective UID is crucial when a program needs to perform actions with privileges different from the user's Real UID. This is common in programs with the `setuid` bit set (explained later).

**Example**:
- A regular user (UID `1000`) may run a program where the Effective UID is changed to `0` (root) temporarily to gain elevated privileges.

### **2.3 Saved User ID (Saved UID)**

- **Definition**: The Saved UID is a backup of the Effective UID. It allows the program to temporarily drop privileges (e.g., drop root access) and then regain them later if needed.
- **Use Case**: The Saved UID is essential in managing programs that need to switch between privileged and unprivileged modes (e.g., performing some operations as root and others as a regular user).

## **3. Setuid and Privilege Escalation**

### **3.1 What is Setuid?**

The **setuid** (set user ID) mechanism allows users to execute files with the privileges of the file owner, rather than the privileges of the user who runs the file. If a file is owned by `root` and has the setuid bit set, it can be executed with root privileges even by a non-root user.

- **Command to Set the Setuid Bit**: `chmod u+s <file>`
  - `u+s`: This option sets the setuid bit on the file.
  - This bit is visible in file permissions as an `s` instead of an `x` for the owner's execute permission.

### **3.2 Setuid Example**

Here’s a C program that prints the Real UID, Effective UID, and Saved UID of a process:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

int main() {
    uid_t real_uid, effective_uid, saved_uid;

    // Get real, effective, and saved user IDs
    if (getresuid(&real_uid, &effective_uid, &saved_uid) == -1) {
        perror("getresuid");
        return 1;
    }

    // Print the real, effective, and saved user IDs
    printf("Real UID: %d\n", real_uid);
    printf("Effective UID: %d\n", effective_uid);
    printf("Saved UID: %d\n", saved_uid);

    return 0;
}
```

### **3.3 Setting the Setuid Bit on a Program**

#### **Step 1: Compile the C Program**
Compile the program using `gcc`:
```bash
gcc -o uid_info uid_info.c
```

#### **Step 2: Change Ownership and Set the Setuid Bit**
- Make the file owned by `root`:
  ```bash
  sudo chown root:root uid_info
  ```
- Set the setuid bit on the file:
  ```bash
  sudo chmod u+s uid_info
  ```

#### **Step 3: Run the Program as a Non-root User**
If you now run the program as a regular user (e.g., UID `1000`), the program will have **root privileges** due to the setuid bit.

```bash
./uid_info
```

**Expected Output** (assuming you're a regular user with UID `1000`):
```
Real UID: 1000
Effective UID: 0
Saved UID: 0
```

### **3.4 Why Does Saved UID Follow Effective UID?**

In setuid programs, the **Saved UID** is initialized to the **Effective UID** when the program starts. This is because the program is running with elevated privileges (Effective UID `0`), and the Saved UID is used to allow the program to drop privileges temporarily and regain them later.

## **4. Different Cases of UIDs and Setuid Behavior**

### **4.1 Case 1: Program Without Setuid**

If the program does not have the setuid bit set, the Real, Effective, and Saved UIDs will all be the same. The program runs with the user’s own privileges.

**Example Output** (run by a regular user):
```
Real UID: 1000
Effective UID: 1000
Saved UID: 1000
```

### **4.2 Case 2: Setuid Program**

When the setuid bit is set and the program is owned by `root`, the **Effective UID** becomes `0`, and the **Saved UID** is also set to `0`.

**Example Output**:
```
Real UID: 1000
Effective UID: 0
Saved UID: 0
```

### **4.3 Case 3: Temporarily Dropping Privileges**

A program with setuid can temporarily switch from a privileged Effective UID (`0`, root) to a non-privileged UID (e.g., `1000`) and then switch back to the Saved UID (`0`).

**Example Output** (after dropping and regaining privileges):
```
Real UID: 1000
Effective UID: 1000
Saved UID: 0
```

### **4.4 Case 4: Permanently Dropping Privileges**

If a program permanently drops its privileges (by changing both the Effective UID and Saved UID), it can no longer regain root privileges.

**Example Output** (after permanent privilege drop):
```
Real UID: 1000
Effective UID: 1000
Saved UID: 1000
```

## **5. Conclusion**

- **Real UID** identifies the original user who started the process.
- **Effective UID** controls the permissions for the running process, which can be changed using the setuid mechanism.
- **Saved UID** allows a process to regain its original elevated privileges after temporarily dropping them.

By understanding how these UIDs work, you can control the privileges of processes effectively, ensuring they operate with the necessary permissions while maintaining security.

### **Important Commands to Remember**
- **Changing file ownership**: `sudo chown root:root <file>`
- **Setting the setuid bit**: `sudo chmod u+s <file>`
- **Checking UIDs in a process**: `getresuid()` system call (C programming)

This knowledge is crucial for managing permissions in Linux systems and is commonly used in scenarios where programs need to run with elevated privileges securely.
