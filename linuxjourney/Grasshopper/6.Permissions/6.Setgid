#Setgid
#Similar to the set user ID permission bit, there is a set group ID (SGID) permission bit. 
#This bit allows a program to run as if it was a member of that group. 

$ ls -l /usr/bin/wall
-rwxr-sr-x 1 root tty 19024 Dec 14 11:45 /usr/bin/wall

# Modifying SGID :

$ sudo chmod g+s myfile
$ sudo chmod 2555 myfile

#the inverse : $ sudo chmod g-s myfile
