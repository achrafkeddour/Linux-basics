SUID (Set User ID) is a special permission that allows users to execute a file with the permissions of the file owner,
rather than (instead of) with the permissions of the user who is running the file. 
This is often used for programs that need elevated privileges to perform specific tasks


we run this : **sudo chmod u+s <file>**

if, **ls -l file** gave me :
**-rwSr-xr-x**
i can execute : **sudo chmod u+x <file>**
to have : **-rwsr-xr-x**

```
This means that:
The s in rws indicates that the SUID (Set User ID) bit is set for that file.
The file can now be executed with the permissions of the file owner (typically root), rather than the permissions of
the user who runs the file.
```
**what does it means ?**
```
If a file has the SUID bit set, when any user (even a regular user) executes that file, it runs as if the owner of
the file is executing it. This is useful when the file owner (often root) needs to grant elevated privileges to
users for specific tasks.
```

Let's say I want to change my password, simple, I just use the passwd command:
$ passwd

What is the password command doing? It's modifying a couple of files, but most importantly it's modifying
the /etc/shadow file. Let's look at that file for a second:

$ ls -l /etc/shadow
-rw-r----- 1 root shadow 1134 Dec 1 11:45 /etc/shadow

Oh wait a minute here, this file is owned by root? How is it possible that we are able to modify a file owned by root?
Let's look at another permission set, this time of the command we ran:

$ ls -l /usr/bin/passwd
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 47032 Dec 1 11:45 /usr/bin/passwd
```
**Modifying SUID**
```
Symbolic way:
# $ sudo chmod u+s myfile
Numerical way:
# $ sudo chmod 4755 myfile 
```
