SUID (Set User ID) is a special permission that allows users to execute a file with the permissions of the file owner,
rather than (instead of) with the permissions of the user who is running the file. 
This is often used for programs that need elevated privileges to perform specific tasks


we run this : **sudo chmod u+s <file>**

if, **ls -l file** gave me :
**-rwSr-xr-x**
i can execute : **sudo chmod u+x <file>**
to have : **-rwsr-xr-x**

```
This means that:
The s in rws indicates that the SUID (Set User ID) bit is set for that file.
The file can now be executed with the permissions of the file owner (typically root), rather than the permissions of
the user who runs the file.
```
**what does it means ?**
```
If a file has the SUID bit set, when any user (even a regular user) executes that file, it runs as if the owner of
the file is executing it. This is useful when the file owner (often root) needs to grant elevated privileges to
users for specific tasks.
