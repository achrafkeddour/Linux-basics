# Package Dependencies

Packages often need **dependencies** to work, just like how restaurants need a farm for ingredients. If the farm stops supplying, the restaurants can’t cook. In Linux, dependencies are usually other **packages** or **shared libraries**, which are pieces of code that programs reuse instead of creating from scratch.

If these dependencies are missing, the package might not install or work, leaving it **broken**. We’ll talk more about shared libraries later, but for now, just remember that packages need dependencies to run properly.
