# tar & gzip 
we need to discuss archiving and compressing files, because you will most likely encounter these when you hunt for software on the internet. 

you've most likely encountered file types such as .rar and .zip. 
These are an **archive of files**, they contain **many files** inside of them, but they come in this very neat single file known as an archive

## Compressing files with gzip 
gzip is program used to **compress** files in Linux, they end in a ```.gz``` extension

To compress a file down:
```
$ gzip mycoolfile
```
To decompress the file:
```
$ gunzip mycoolfile.gz
```
