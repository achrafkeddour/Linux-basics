# Software Distribution

Your system uses many different types of software like internet browsers, text editors, and media players. These are called **packages**, and they’re managed by **package managers**.

### What Do Package Managers Do?
- **Package managers** help you **install** and **update** and **uninstall** software easily
- Most of the time, you'll use a package manager to install software.
- Some packages can also be installed manually from their **source code**, but we’ll cover that later.

### Types of Packages:
- The two most common package formats are:
  - **Debian (.deb)** — used in **Ubuntu**, **Debian**, **LinuxMint**, etc.
  - **Red Hat (.rpm)** — used in **Fedora**, **CentOS**, **Red Hat Enterprise Linux**, etc.

### What Are Packages?

Think of packages as apps, like **Google Chrome** or **Photoshop**. Technically, they’re just a **collection of many files bundled together**.

- **Upstream providers** (the people or teams who make the software) write the code and bundle it into a package.
- They also update the software regularly and make sure it works.
  
Once the software is ready to share with users, they send it to **package maintainers**.

### Role of Package Maintainers:
- **Package maintainers** make sure the software is safe and works well.
- They then distribute the software to users via package managers.
