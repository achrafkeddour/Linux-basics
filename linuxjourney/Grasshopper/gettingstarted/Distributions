Many distributions use the Linux kernel so therefore are commonly known as Linux operating systems
Every Linux distribution installs and manages packages differently


A Linux system is divided into three main parts:

1.   Hardware - This includes all the hardware that your system runs on as well as memory, CPU, disks, etc.
2.   Linux Kernel - As we discussed above, the kernel is the core of the operating system. 
                   It manages the hardware and tells it how to interact with the system.
3.   User Space - This includes apps, system libraries, user interfaces, as well as utilities and tools that run on top of the kernel


Debian :     is an operating system composed entirely of free and open-source software. 
There are three branches that you can use, Stable, Testing and Unstable. 
Stable is an overall good branch to be on. Testing and Unstable are rolling releases. (kol mara haja jdida)
