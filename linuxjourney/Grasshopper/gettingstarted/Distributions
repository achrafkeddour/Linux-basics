Many distributions use the Linux kernel so therefore are commonly known as Linux operating systems

A Linux system is divided into three main parts:

    Hardware - This includes all the hardware that your system runs on as well as memory, CPU, disks, etc.
    Linux Kernel - As we discussed above, the kernel is the core of the operating system. 
                   It manages the hardware and tells it how to interact with the system.
    User Space - This includes apps, system libraries, user interfaces, as well as utilities and tools that run on top of the kernel
