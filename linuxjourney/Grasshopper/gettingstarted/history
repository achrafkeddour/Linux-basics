the kernel is the most important piece in the OS that allows the hardware to talk to the software 
it controls pretty much everything that happens on your system. 

In 1969, K.Thompson and D.Ritchie of Bell Laboratories developed the UNIX operating system. 
It was later rewritten in C to make it more portable and eventually became a widely used operating system. 

then Richard Stallman started working on the GNU (GNU is Not UNIX) project ,which unfortunately never came to completion.
its goal was to create a free and open-source operating system that mimicked Unix's capabilities without using any Unix code. 
This ensures that GNU is free from the restrictions and licensing issues associated with Unix.

During this time other efforts such as BSD, MINIX, etc were developed to be UNIX like-systems.
one thing that all these UNIX like-systems had in common was the lack of a unified kernel. (kol wahed w kernel ta3ou) 

In 1991, a young fellow named 'Linus Torvalds' started developing : 'The Linux kernel'.
so the Linux kernel is a Unix-like kernel that embodies the design principles and standards of Unix
so Linux is an open-source operating system kernel inspired by Unix.
