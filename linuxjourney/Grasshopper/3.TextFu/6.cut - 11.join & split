'

$ cut -c 5 sample.txt 
#this commade gimme a result :

#also if i have a file sample.txt with content :

dog     cat      mouse

cut -f 2 sample.txt gimme : banana
                            cat

# -f or field flag cuts text based off of fields, by default it uses TABs as delimiters (ki nel9a TAB n9ol kemelt filed) ,
#so everything separated by a TAB is considered a separated field. 

#but we can manipulate and specify the delimiter !
#for example im gonna make the 'e' as a deleimeter ( ki nl9aha n9ol ani kemelt field) 

cut -f 1 -d "e" sample.txt , this give me : 
appl
dog     cat      mous

#7 paste : Combine all lines into one line .. but delimited by ' ' (by default , or i can cahnge and specify the delimiter)

$ paste sample.txt         #same result as cat sample.txt
apple   banana   cherry
dog     cat      mouse

$ paste -s sample.txt 
apple   banana   cherry	dog     cat      mouse

$ paste -d 'w' -s sample.txt
apple   banana   cherrywdog     cat      mouse

$ paste -d '' -s sample.txt       #delimiter is nothing
apple   banana   cherrydog     cat      mouse


#8 : head   ,  by default the head command will show you only the first 10 lines in a file.
$ head file.txt 
#You can also modify the line count to whatever you choose, let's say I wanted to see the first 15 lines instead
$ head -n 15 file.txt
