cut -f 2 sample.txt gimme : banana
                            cat

# -f or field flag cuts text based off of fields, by default it uses TABs as delimiters (ki nel9a TAB n9ol kemelt filed) ,
#so everything separated by a TAB is considered a separated field. 

#but we can manipulate and specify the delimiter !
#for example im gonna make the 'e' as a deleimeter ( ki nl9aha n9ol ani kemelt field) 

cut -f 1 -d "e" sample.txt , this give me : 
appl
dog     cat      mous
